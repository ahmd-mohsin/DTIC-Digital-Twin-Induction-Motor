## Details
In this model, we basically present an efficient method to predict the fault in motors using digital twin and predictive machine learning models to estimate the fault in induction motor. The faults in an induction motor can be broken down into three different categories which are bearing faults, stator faults and unbalanced voltages and centricity. These faults have direct impact on two important parameters which are vibrational signals and stator currents, and these two parameters will be used in our predictive machine learning model for further analysis. All the other parameters are physical in nature and cannot be modelled using simulated motors. This includes using detection models on sensory thermography, oil analysis, and ultrasound data.
